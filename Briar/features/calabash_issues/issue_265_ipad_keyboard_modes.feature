  # NB: tried using an outline for these tests, but i found flickering tests
  # and the html report was not providing enough information
  #  Scenario Outline: i should be able tell what mode the keyboard is in regardless of orientation
  #    Then I should be able to <mode1> the keyboard
  #    Then I check the keyboard mode is stable across orientations
  #    Then I should be able to <mode2> the keyboard
  #    Then I check the keyboard mode is stable across orientations
  #    Then I should be able to <mode3> the keyboard
  #    Then I check the keyboard mode is stable across orientations
  #  Examples:
  #    | mode1  | mode2  | mode3  |
  #    | dock   | undock | dock   |
  #    | dock   | split  | dock   |
  #    | undock | dock   | undock |

  # flickering
  # iPhone 6 sim and device - NO_LAUNCH
  #  - cannot seem to consistently find the ` character on iphone
  # iPad 1 iOS 5 and iPad Simulator iOS 6 no launch because
  #  - the text is sometimes entered into the top tf instead of the bottom text field
  # iOS 7
  #  - uia_type_string reports that it cannot type a string, but the string has been typed
  #  - problem is issue 310

  Scenario Outline: i should be able to use the keyboard regardless of orientation or mode
    Given I am looking at the Text tab
    And I have touched the "top" text field
    Then I rotate the device <rotate> times in a random direction
    Then I put the keyboard into a random mode
    Then I type <emails> email addresses into the text fields
    Then I rotate the device <rotate> times in a random direction
    Then I type <random> random strings with the full range of characters into the text fields
  Examples:
    | rotate | emails | random |
    | 3      | 1      | 1      |
    | 3      | 1      | 1      |
